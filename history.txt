Before beginning this unit I did not know much about the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I had never really gotten interested in that conflict, and all I knew was from random snippets from the news. While reading the reading for this unit, however, I was incredibly fascinated by the resilience of the state of Israel. For instance, when it was first formed in 1948, nearly all of its neighboring countries - including Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria - simultaneously attacked it, and not only was Israel able to counter every one of these invasions, but by the end of the war (called ‘The Catastrophe’ by the Arabs) it controlled more land than was originally given to it by the UN. In 1967, Israel fought Egypt, Syria, and Jordan simultaneously again, and defeated all 3 to take over the Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, Golan Heights, and the West Bank. Why was it so successful militarily? Perhaps because Israel had more reason to be determined in their struggle, since their very existence was at risk, while the Arab states were merely combatting for the maintenance of their borders. Another important factor was that the US provided significant military aid to Israel after WWII, eventually entering a formal military partnership that is continued today. This was in part due to Cold War concerns - for instance, after 1967 the US provided massive military support to Israel while the USSR provided Egypt and Syria with arms as tension between Israel and the Arabs flared up. It was interesting to see an instance where US intervention during the Cold War actually turned up almost completely successful - for, throughout the Cold War, as we learned in class, the US provided much aid to countries that it thought were under risk of becoming communist, but this did not often work out. For instance, Reagan’s administration provided military materiel and training to the contras, a guerilla army seeking to overthrow the government at the time in Nicaragua in the 1970s, because of the suspected Marxist beliefs held by that government (the Sandinista). However, the contras were ultimately defeated, and the whole scene was a debacle for the United States. Elsewhere in Latin America, in Guatemala, US-backed forces were successful in overthrowing the allegedly communist-friendly government, but the leader they placed in power was assassinated by the army shortly after, and decades of civil war and instability followed. Perhaps Israel gave the US an overly positive view of the efficacy of its intervention in foreign countries, which led to the misguided interventions later in the Cold War that ended up more often than not destabilizing the nations where they took place.
