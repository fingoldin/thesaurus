DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the
BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY.
Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls
the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the
seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through
a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.
The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from
the rear view to the road to the rear view.
DEADPOOL
Kinda lonesome back here.
CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening
between the back seat and front. His two katanas don’t
cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Little help?
The cabbie grabs Deadpool’s hand and pulls him through to the
front. Deadpool’s head rests upside down on the bench seat
as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the
helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice.
CABBIE
Dopinder.
DEADPOOL
(still upside-down)
Pool. Deadpool.
Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab.
DOPINDER
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
DEADPOOL
It’s like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been
waiting one thousand eight hundred twentytwo
days, three hours...
(checks ‘Adventure Time’
watch)
...and thirty-six minutes for this shit.

 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 1.
 DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He
 is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS.
 TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS.
 Deadpool grabs Dopinder’s OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder
 isn’t quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the
 window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that
 looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic.
 Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of
 the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY.
 Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points.
 DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
 Nice.
 Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR 
 DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
 So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu
 hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the
 whole world will taste like Mama June
 after hot yoga.
 DOPINDER
 And how does Ms. Mama June taste?
 DEADPOOL
 Like two hobos making love under a
 drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day
 like this. Point is, bad.
 Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and
 pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two
 magazines.
 Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood
 agent who can’t find his phone.
 DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
 Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave
 them right by the door so I’ll trip over
 them! Someone must’ve moved them...
 2 INT. DEADPOOL’S LAIR - DAY 2
 A blind late-70’s AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral
 dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an ‘I
 *HEART* HELLO KITTY’ DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP,
 and CARRIES it OFF.
 3 INT./EXT. TAXI CAB - MORNING 3
 DOPINDER
 Shall we turn back?
 DEADPOOL
 No time. Not today.
 (slides in last bullets)
 Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust.
 (chambers a shell into each
 gun, looks up)
 Right here!
 The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest
 FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts
 the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD.
 DOPINDER
 My card. That’s $27.50.

  DEADPOOL
  Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm
  working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
  How 'bout a crisp high five?
  Dopinder stares as he and Deadpool slap skin. Deadpool GETS
  OUT of the cab.
  DOPINDER
  Be sure to... ask for me again?
  DEADPOOL
  I owe you one. Merry Christmas,
  Dopinder.
  DOPINDER
  And a convivial... Tuesday in April to
  you, Pool... Guy.
  Deadpool closes the door with a flourish. Boom.
  4 EXT./INT. ‘THE RAFT’ PRISON - MORNING 4
  A bone-white ISLAND PRISON, affectionately nicknamed ‘The
  Raft,’ looms ominously in a CITY HARBOR.
  Etched in helvetica into the prison wall: ‘No punishment has
  ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the
  commission of crimes.’ - Hannah Arendt. Below it, GRAFFITIED
  in RED SPRAY PAINT: ‘Until NOW’
  The prison’s FRONT DOORS OPEN, and out steps a handcuffed
  PRISONER, 30’s, ORANGE JUMPSUIT, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
  tightly coiled, with cool, dead-blue eyes. BURLY GUARDS
  guide him across a CAUSEWAY toward a CONVOY of Escalades and
  Ducatis on shore.
  The middle Escalade’s door opens. The prisoner stops. The
  guards unlock his CUFFS.
  GUARD
  You’re someone else’s problem now.
  The ex-prisoner STRETCHES his arms and strides TOWARD the
  convoy.
  PRISONER
  Yes. I. Am.

   5 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 5
   DEADPOOL sits on the edge of the highest freeway on the
   overpass, legs dangling over the side like Huck Finn.
   DEADPOOL
   Can I get some fries with that shakeshake
   boobie? If looks could kill you
   would be an uzi.
   Deadpool is using some broken CRAYONS to draw something on a
   scrap of paper. REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL a childish drawing
   of Deadpool SHOOTING another man in the head, brains blowing
   out.
   The victim’s thought bubble reads: ‘OUCHIE!!!’ Even through
   the mask, Deadpool looks pleased by this.
   He turns to CAMERA:
   DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
   Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be
   wondering whose balls I had to fondle to
   get my own movie. Rhymes with
   ‘Polverine.’ Couple’a smooth criminals.
   (ALT:)
   In a word, gorgeous.
   (ALT:)
   Surprisingly little hair down there.
   (ALT:)
   It’s a jungle down there.
   (ALT:)
   Thick underbrush.
   (beat)
   Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit’s gonna
   match the carpet. Now... places to be...
   faces to fix... bad guys to kill...
   ANGLE ON a distant BIRD’S EYE VIEW of the freeway
   interchange: an interwoven tangle of ramps.
   6 EXT. REMOTE AIRFIELD - MORNING 6
   AJAX, 30’s, dead-blue eyes, broad shoulders, whip-smart,
   tightly coiled stands at ease on a cracked and blistered
   tarmac. Behind him, a HEAVILY ARMED CONVOY OF DUCATIS and
   ESCALADES. FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside him.
   Ajax squints into the sun as A BELL HELICOPTER thrashes the
   air above him, kicking up dust as it lands.
   (CONTINUED)
    Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 5.
    A SERBIAN WARLORD, mid-50’s, sharply dressed, armored
    BRIEFCASE in hand, climbs out. He is surrounded by ARMED
    GUARDS.
    The Warlord places the BRIEFCASE on the FOREMOST CRATE. Ajax
    pops the case... to find STACKS upon STACKS of THOUSAND
    DOLLAR BILLS. Satisfied, he closes the briefcase and hands
    it to one of his men.
    AJAX
    (bangs crate)
    They won’t disappoint.
    WARLORD
    They’d better not. And next month’s
    shipment?
    AJAX
    There won’t be one. Demand is high. You
    aren’t the only one with a war to win.
    WARLORD
    (steps forward)
    That won’t do.
    Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions.
    Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUALLY
    LIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers find
    triggers on both sides.
    AJAX
    There’s been a small... disruption in our
    supply chain. We’ll deliver in full the
    following month. Say, ten percent off
    for the inconvenience?
        The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence. Ajax smiles
        again, lowers him gasping to the ground.
        AJAX (CONT’D)
        We appreciate your business.
        Ajax spins and walks purposefully toward the line of waiting
        SUV’s.
        The warlord angrily motions for his men to begin loading the
        crates into the helicopter, which they do.
        WARLORD
        (sotto voce)
        Fucking mutant.

         Behind him the convoy of SUV’s and motorcycles pull out,
         falling into line as they accelerate past the rows of
         derelict aircraft.
         7 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 7
         DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets
         up as if standing up out of an easy chair...
         DEADPOOL
         On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let
         me shoop...
         He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN...
         8 INT. ESCALADE - MORNING 8
         THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE. SMASH!
         There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in
         front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM
         of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the
         face as he raises his arms in greeting.
         DEADPOOL
         ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte!
         (subtitled, in YELLOW:)
         Hello! My name is the Pool of Death.
         There’s no easy way to say this. I’m
         pregnant, Trevor.
         (ALT:)
         Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me
         neither.
         BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves
         sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS.
         FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING.
         From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on
         its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE.
         A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with
         it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man’s NECK. The other man
         stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool’s
         face into the seat’s premium trim.
         DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
         Rich... Corinthian... Leather.
         Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW.
         The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V.
         Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.

          DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
          Scuse, por favor!
          The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool’s head into the console repeatedly.
          DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
          Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
          Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in
          the PASSENGER SEAT.
          He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy’s
          ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy’s
          HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he’s DRAGGED
          mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just
          got stuck in his horse’s STIRRUP.
          Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD
          and BANGS his FOREHEAD into:
          The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver’s
          forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION
          CHANGES:
          MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL (’SUNDAY,
          SUNDAY, SUNDAY!’). One more SMACK to get us back to
          MARIACHI.
          Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back
          CRAWL up the tailgate.
          Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac’s CIGARETTE LIGHTER.
          Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the
          DRIVER’s SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.
          We’re now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver’s
          expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of
          pain every time it’s MUSHED into the glass.
          The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER
          POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in
          back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD.
          Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man’s
          forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man
          SCREAMS.
          DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
          Loved your work in Daredevil.
          Deadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man’s mouth and CLAMPS
          his hand over it.

           The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled
           AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path.
           The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN.
           Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver’s
           neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the
           OTHER hand still clamped over the second man’s mouth. He
           plants both FEET on the steering wheel and ‘drives,’ spinning
           the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into...
           ...a ROLL. The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY.
           Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW...
           The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The
           tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike.
           Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The
           RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING.
           Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER
           flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass.
           BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing
           CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in
           the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB
           tied to MOBY DICK.
           The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES.
           The camera swoops in to Deadpool’s face, upside down.
           HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE
           FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT’S MOVING:
           DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
           Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
           We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The
           guy’s ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high
           toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame.
           The RIDER’s NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN.
           The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rolls
           over him. SQUISH.
           The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement.
